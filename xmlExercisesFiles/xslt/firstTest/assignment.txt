Task 3. XSLT Transformation
    
    Write address-book-to-html.xsl stylesheet producing a XHTML 1.0 STRICT
    output (i.e. DOCTYPE PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" document).
    Alternatively, you can produce an HTML 5 output with the same content.
    Use the XSLT 1.0 version. 
    
    For testing purposes, you can run the transformation directly 
    from NetBeans (right-click on the .xml file and 
    select XSL Transformation).
    
    Requirements for the transformation:
    
    1. Expected output is shown in address-book_output.html
    2. When a person does not have an id, nothing at all is produced for him/her.
    3. For each e-mail, one line with the e-mail is shown.
    4. If there is no contact, the "No contacts" is produced.
    5. If there are some contacts, but the contacts element has visible="false"
       then "Some contacts but not visible".
    6. if the contacts as a whole are visible contacts element has visible="true"
       then for each contact marked as invisible, display "An invisible contact"
